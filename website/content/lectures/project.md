A key component of this course is the final project. For your final
project, you will be expected to explore and present on a topic that
involves the use of markup. You are enouraged to work it teams of
three or fewer people, but working alone is also an option. Obviously
this is a very open-ended assignment, and the deliverables will vary
from team to team. For example, some teams may end up producing a
complete web application that is accessible online. Others may produce
scripts run from the command line that manipulate some markup. Other
teams may do no programming at all, instead choosing to document and
explore an existing markup language like TEI or MathML. Most
importantly, you should choose a project topic that is interesting. I
encourage all projects to be publicly accessible, though this is not a
requirement. A publicly accessible project can be something to point
to on a resume or even more broadly useful to the public at large.

In two weeks (on October 16) you or a representative from your group
will be expected to describe your project topic briefly (under 1
minute) to the class. No slides or deliverables are required, just a
quick description.
