# Licenses

Licenses are a very important part of open source software, and they are nearly as varied as the software itself. Checkout the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org), their summary of licenses, and their FAQs to get a feel for the territory. Also, for another (slightly competing) view checkout ["What is free software?"](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) from the Free Software Foundation.

When picking a license, our textbook offers some good advice to choose a license that ["many potential users and contributors will already be familiar with it"](http://producingoss.com/en/license-quickstart.html). Also, please read and understand [chapter 9](http://producingoss.com/en/legal.html).


## Public Domain

Public domain software is software (code or binaries) that claim to be free of copyright. That might sound simple enough, but as the free software foundation notes:

> Under the Berne Convention, which most countries have signed, anything written down is automatically copyrighted. This includes programs. Therefore, if you want a program you have written to be in the public domain, you must take some legal steps to disclaim the copyright on it; otherwise, the program is copyrighted.
(see: [Public Domain Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html#PublicDomainSoftware))

## MIT, BSD-Style, & Permissive Licenses

Let's take a look at the (very short) MIT License:

>    Copyright (c) 2016, Matt Bone

>
>    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

>
>    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

And the similar BSD License:

> Copyright (c) 2016, Matt Bone
> All rights reserved.
> 
> Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:
>

>
> 3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
>
> THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

The popular [Apache License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) takes things a step further by including mention of software patents.

### Do No Evil

Douglas Crockford has been causing trouble (good trouble) for years, and it stil stirring it up with his ['do no evil' license for JSMin](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSMin/blob/master/jsmin.c).
