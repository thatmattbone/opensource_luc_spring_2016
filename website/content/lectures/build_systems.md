# Build Systems

Even with open source software, most of the time we download binary packages when we need them. But these binaries were built somehow! Perhaps [more](https://www.netbsd.org/) than proprietary software, open source tools must run on a wide range of operating sytems and hardware. It's a tricky task.

Build systems, from simple to complex, can automate some of these tasks. Today we'll limit ourselves to looking at systems we run interactively, but in the future we'll look at how some of these tools are utilized by automatic systems.

## A Simple Compilation

```
$ wget https://www.sqlite.org/2016/sqlite-autoconf-3100200.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf sqlite-autoconf-3100200.tar.gz
$ cd sqlite-autoconf-3100200

```
