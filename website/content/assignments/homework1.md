# Homework 1

**Due January 25, 11:55pm**

For homework 1, you will read the (original version of the) essay by Neal Stephenson called "In the Beginning was the Command Line" and write a short reaction (about a page) to the piece. The idea is to get warmed up and excited about open source software. Don't overthink your writing. Just show me you've read the essay and have thought about the content. You may wish to comment on how things have changed since it was written, how it relates to your existing understanding of open source software, or the political implications of some of the ideas. We will discuss your reactions next week. Please submit this assignment on sakai.
