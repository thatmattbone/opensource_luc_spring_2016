# Homework 3

For homework 3 you will find three open source projects with 10 or more contributors and answer the following questions:

1. What is the history of the project? How did it come to be? What problem did it originally intend to solve?

2. What license does the project use? Why was this license chosen?

3. What is the process for submitting bug reports?

4. What is the process for getting code submitted and accepted into the project?

5. What are the mechanisms for communication and collaboration?

You will submit the answers for all three projects to me. Choose your favorite project and prepare a short, oral presentation (no slides, etc) of these questions. Your presentation should tell the story of the project. You will present this to the class.
