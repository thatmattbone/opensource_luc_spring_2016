# Project

As we've discussed in class, the project should constitute a meaningful contribution to an open source project. This could be writing docs about the project, reporting bugs, fixing bugs, contributing to the mailing list, etc.

Please submit the project on sakai. Your submission may just be to point me to your repo or you may choose to submit all materials there.
